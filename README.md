# fintech-pandas-analysis
My FinTech homework, incorporating knowledge learnt through an intro to Pandas.
One has to love Pandas!
It makes visualising data an absolute synch.  Where has it been all my life?!

## Instructions
Within this Project, there is one main Jupyter Notebook.
 - Whale Analysis (whale_analysis.ipynb)
 - There isn't much that one needs to do as far as instructions go.
 - All you do is: -
   - Execute the Notebook, either in its entirety or cell by cell.
   - As you proceed, read the comments, the data and the different types of charts displayed.

### Analysis
The Notebook is primarly divided into 2 parts: -
- Whale Analysis (first part)
  - Run through it. It is fairly self-explanatory
- My Portfolio Analysis
  - Also, easy to follow, but different in that a portfolio of price data is built up into the "My Portfolio" Pandas DataFrame, working through some analysis on it.
- Finally, the former and latter portfolios are combined and some analysis performed on them too, ending in the final conclusion.

### Sources
- For this little project, there weren't really any specific sources I consulted, except: -
  - Python docs themselves, located [here](https://docs.python.org/3/).
  - Pandas documentation as well, [here](hhttps://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html).
  - The Google Finance API (as part of Google Sheets) which I found fun to read about and use (I downloaded some closing prices for the two TSX stocks I added to "My Portfolio").  Some notes on how to use it found [here](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093281).
